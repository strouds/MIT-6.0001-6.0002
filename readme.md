These are the solved problem set files for when I completed the MIT 6.0001 "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python" and 6.0002 "Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science" courses in spring of 2021. These are from the freely available 2016 version of the course available on ocw.mit.edu.
